    "In this assignment in contrast to the previous one, we consider a dynamical model of a 3-wheel robot instead of a kinematic model. It means that now we assume the robot has mass, hence it has inertia as well. Therefore we can't control velocity of the robot directly and will apply pushing force and steering torque instead. The new system will take the following form:\n",

    "Recall that, in general, there is an **observation model** which can be interpreted as **measurement**, i.e., what is outputted \"from\" the system to the outside world is a function of the state. In particular, the output function may return just a part of the state vector. In many control tasks, it is necessary, however, to recover the information about the full state vector. The corresponding task is called **\"state estimation\"** and is usually addressed by the so called state observers. Perhaps the most common state observer is a **bayesian filter** that performs estimation using bayesian inference. Roughly speaking, it seeks to maximize the likelihood of the state estimate given the observed output. A particular variant of a baeysian filter is the extended kalman filter which we will implement from scratch further.\n",

So why do we even want to apply bayesian machinery for this task? The problem is inevitable computation error which accumulates during time. So we need some tool that helps us to increase the precision of positioning based on knowledge of the system itself. Kalman filter is literally what solves this problem and obtains near-optimal estimations of the system under some mild conditions."

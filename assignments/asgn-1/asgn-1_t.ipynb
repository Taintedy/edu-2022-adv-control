    "## Advanced Control Methods | Assignment 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Birdview\n",
    "\n",
    "The course on the Advanced Control Methods is being delivered by the Labortory of Artificial Intelligence in Dynamic Action(AIDA). The majority of the assignments will involve the usage of *rcognita* - a framework for simulation and visualization of the dynamical systems, that is under development in the laboratory.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be four assignments in the couse:\n",
    "- NN Estimator\n",
    "- Model Predictive Control (MPC)\n",
    "- Kalman filter\n",
    "- Classical CV-based recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the assignments will be given after a lecture and a seminar on the topic it involves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction & theory recap\n",
    "\n",
    "The two-wheeled floor robot is set to perform a circular motion with control that is constant over time. This assignment is devoted to the implementation of an estimator - a neural network, that predicts the next state of the dynamical system (of our robot) given the current state and current control. The system is considered as a discrete one. Specifically,\n",

    "$x_k$ - state from state space $\\mathbb{X}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$u_k$ - action from action space $\\mathbb{U}$,\n",
    "\n",
    "and we are interested in **learning** a function *e* (estimator) such that\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_{k+1} = e(x_k, u_k)$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do that that via gradient gescent with pytorch. In the first half of the assignment the estimator will be trained on a pre-recorded state-action trajetory, and in the second it will train on the fly on a sliding buffer with the recent states and actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment consists of three parts. The first and the second are (for the sake of speeding up the calculations) organized in the form of the default ML setting: there is a fixed dataset and the goal is to minimize a loss function over it. Note the form of the train-test split (by a cetrain point in time, not by random permutation) that is used in the Section 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each section the places for your code are marked with\n",
    "\n",
    "#############################################\\\n",

    "Fill all of them, following the extended problem formulation in each section.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the sections of the assignment are devoted to\n",
    "- **Section 1:** familiarizing yourself to the state-action trajectory setting *code-wise*. Training the simplest NN possble to reproduce its input (also known as the Identity learning)\n",
    "- **Section 2:** implementing models that are really capable of estimating something. Comparing them (mainly in visual form by their predictions in a range of hyperparameters\n",
    "- **Section 3:** integrating the best model (the one with the best performing hyperparameters) in the simulation of the robot\n",
    "\n",
    "Only the results of the section 3 will be graded. Although, it is necessary to build up the understanding via solving the problems that are given in the sections 1 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the third section there are cells that are necessary for rcognita to work. There is no need to dive very deeply into them (the assignment is about the estimator), but they are worth reading a couple of times just to get a sense of what's going on here.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let us move towards the end goal via small incremental steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first problem is devoted to the simplest case possible of the estimator learning. Here we will set up an estimator that will predict not the next state, but the current state. In other words, it will learn an identity function, mapping $x$ to $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem will not be graded, it is here for demonstrational purposes only. As it was mentioned before, the learning here will be preformed on a pre-recorded buffer. Examine the code, the data preparation. *x* coordinate of the robot is plotted as a function of time to check if the data makes sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the only parameter that is passed to the constructor of *ModelRNN_linear*. Function *model_out* inputs both observation and action, but the latter is ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single-layer neural network applies $Ax + b$ linear function to the input. Thus, after sufficient number of gradient descent steps, it is expected to *learn* nearly zero vector for $b$ and nearly identity matrix for $A$. In order to observe these parameters directly, they are printed after the training is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task here is to insert the code in two places in the cell below. Please make a neural network of a single fully connected layer and apply it to the input in the *forward* finction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you happy with the loss decay rate? Try changing optimizer hyperparameters, try changing loss function. Try applying gradient clipping (which was originally intended to be a way of preventing gradients from exploding, see https://neptune.ai/blog/understanding-gradient-clipping-and-how-it-can-fix-exploding-gradients-problem for a detailed explanation) and compare the results.\n",

Since both processes are (in implementation) discrete, the control generation begins with a delay after $dt$ passed, which results in the lower sampling frequency.

    "Now, after the simulation has finished, let us assess the performance of the model. In order to do so we have to compare the difference between the predicted next states and real ones with the same thing for a different estimator, because the bare number is not meaningful. Let us use a simplest estimator possible - it will give its input state as an output. Surprisingly enough, it will give outstandingly good results in comparison to the learned one.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several factors overlapping here. First, *dt* (step size) of the simulation is small (go check *argparser* for its value). Consequently, the robot barely moves, and subsequent observations are close to each other. Second, we do not have very much data, the trajectory consists of nearly $400$ samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem the hyperparameters are crucially important. Avoid changing *lr* randomly until it works :)\n",
    "\n",
    "The grade is calculated out of the model's performance on the tail part of the trajectory (approximately one third), when the convergence of the model is more or less reached. The values of the average deviation by $L_1$ and $MSE$ are compared to the ones of the author's solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of the trivial estimator (*predicted_state* = *previous_state*) are given for reference. The advantages of the estimator become evident case of long prediction horizons (more than one step), complex control signals. Looking ahead, we will need that while working on MPC. But that's a whole another story.\n",
